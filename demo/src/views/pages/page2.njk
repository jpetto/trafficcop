                You guys have it real easy. I never had it like this where I
                grew up. But I send my kids here because the fact is you go to
                one of the best schools in the country: Rushmore. Now, for some
                of you it doesn't matter. You were born rich and you're going to
                stay rich. But here's my advice to the rest of you: Take dead
                aim on the rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs and take them
                down. Just remember, they can buy anything but they can't buy
                backbone. Don't let them forget it. Thank you.
            </p>
